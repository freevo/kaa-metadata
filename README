Known Bugs:

Date should be returned as int in seconds since the epoch. This should
be the case for jpg, avi, mp4 and mkv. The mp3 parser returns the date
as it was set in the ID3 field. Since there is no real standard, this
can be everything from the year to a complex string. The current
possible values for ogg and flac are untested, other parser have no
date field. But checking date for int should mean that the value is
seconds since epoch.
